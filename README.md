# Simple DNS Recon
a bash script for subdomains enum using different set of tools at once tends to automate the recon phase as much as possible for nightly recon;

sdr.sh simple dns recone uses sublist3r amass cert and cerspotter to get subdomains then it uses httprobe to probe for ssl and finally uses aquatone to get webscreenshot into a folder and generates a report in that folder.

# Conf
edit the script with the required binaries paths and different lists of your choice for a variety of tools
